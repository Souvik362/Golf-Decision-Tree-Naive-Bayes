# Golf Decision Tree using Naive Bayes

This project uses a Naive Bayes classifier to determine whether to play golf based on weather conditions. The conditions include outlook, temperature, humidity, and wind. The classification is based on probabilities calculated from historical data.

## Features

- Calculates the probability of playing golf given specific weather conditions.
- Uses conditional probabilities to make predictions.
- Includes an example with a specific dayâ€™s weather conditions.
